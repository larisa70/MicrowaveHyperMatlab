# MicrowaveHyperMatlab

Here is description of Matlab code (located in the file MatlabCodeAlltimes.zip)

used for generation of data to be able run C++/PETSc  code located in  private directory

https://github.com/ProjectWaves24/MESH

The Matlab code was used in computations of the paper
L. Beilina, M. G. Aram, E. M. Karchevskii,
An adaptive finite element method for solving 3D electromagnetic volume integral equation with applications in microwave thermometry,
Journal of Computational Physics, V. 459, 2022, 111122, ISSN 0021-9991,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111122.

as well as to obtain least squares reconstructions reported in the paper
